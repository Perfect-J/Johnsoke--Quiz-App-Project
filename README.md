My Quiz App software designing
Purpose:
The purpose of my Quiz App is to provide an interactive platform for conducting question and answer-based quizzes. It aims to transition the traditional pen-and-paper format to a computer-based system, similar to popular standardized exams like JAMB (Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board). By digitizing the quiz process, the app seeks to enhance efficiency, accuracy, and accessibility for both quiz organizers and participants.

Target Audience:
The Quiz App is designed to cater to both primary and secondary schools. It aims to serve educators, students, and quiz organizers in these educational settings. By targeting a broad audience range, the app aims to facilitate learning, knowledge assessment, and friendly competition among students across different grade levels.

Summarize what you've accomplished with your project**
In this diagram, the user interacts with the User Interface, which could be a web or mobile interface. The user submits their answers or interacts with quiz-related features through the interface. The data is then sent to the Backend, which handles data processing, performs the necessary calculations or validations, and interacts with the Database. The Backend communicates with the Database to store and retrieve quiz questions, user information, and scoring data.
